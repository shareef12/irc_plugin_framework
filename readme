Plugins
=======
This framework supports irc plugins. Every PRIVMSG that is received will be sent to all plugins for action. Every plugin is expected to implement three functions:

int init(void) -> Conduct any plugin-specific actions on load
int handle(char *src, char *dst, char *msg) -> Actions to take on receipt of a PRIVMSG
int fini(void) -> Conduct any plugin-specific actions on unload

A basic irc API is provided. Plugins should include api/plugin.h to access these functions.

Dependencies
============
libssl-dev

Compiling
=========
Add the plugin source file to PLUGIN_SOURCES in plugins/makefile
Run make from the plugins directory
Have the maintainer contact the bot over irc to load the plugin

Maintainer commandes
====================
From IRC, the maintainer can control the plugins the bot loads and unloads. Plugins can be controlled through pm's with the bot. Commands are below:

!list -> Show loaded plugins
!load <plugin> -> Load a specific plugin
!unload <plugin> -> Unload a specific plugin
!reload <plugin> -> Reload a specific plugin
!reload all -> Reload all currently loaded plugins
